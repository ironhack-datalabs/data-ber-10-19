Who am I

My name is Lena and I'm from a small city close to Hamburg.
Three weeks ago, I graduated fom university with a Bachelors degree in B.A.
Unfortunately, I do not have any prior experience with data science or data technology.
However, my prior job as working student at Siemens introduced me into the field of open innovation and technology management.
