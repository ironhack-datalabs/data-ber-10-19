We should check whether two matrices have the same number of rows and the same number of columns. We compare the number of rows by looking at the outer list and then check the inner lists to see that they are of the same length as well. Our first function will be to check that our matrix is 2 dimensional. We will perform this check by raising an error for any case except a two dimensional matrix."
